# ιδέα


Idéa is an application with the purpose of expanding the coverage of education, through interactive and dynamic ideas, in which it is possible to apply improvements to the educational system through the implementation of international models that facilitate learning, from both a technical and socio-emotional point of view.

It should also be noted that it has been conceived with a focus on learning and training, not on certification. In other words, it is intended to present material dedicated to teaching and literacy. It consists of support that is not necessarily linked to an academic degree.
